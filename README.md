# üß† Online Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) using CNN and Bi-GRU Networks

This project presents a deep learning approach to **Online Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER)** using a hybrid model of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRU)**. The goal is to accurately recognize complex handwritten math expressions in real time.
